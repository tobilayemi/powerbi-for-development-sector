# Prerequisites {-}

This chapter outlines what you need before working through the rest of
this book. The goal is to ensure that all readers start from a **shared
baseline**, regardless of prior experience.

Nothing here is advanced. If you can open Power BI Desktop and follow
simple instructions, you are ready.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Software Requirements

### Power BI Desktop

You must have **Power BI Desktop** installed.

-   **Platform:** Windows 10 or 11
-   **Version:** Latest stable release (updated monthly)
-   **Download:**
    [powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/)

All examples, screenshots, and exercises in this book use Power BI
Desktop.

> **Note on Licensing:** Power BI Desktop is **free**. A paid Power BI
> Pro license is *not* required to follow the exercises in this book.

### A Note for Mac Users

Power BI Desktop **does not run natively on macOS**. If you are using a
Mac, you have two options: 

1. Install Windows on your Mac using a virtual machine (e.g., Parallels or VMWare). 
2. Use a Windows 365 Cloud PC.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Hardware Recommendations

Power BI is an in-memory tool. For the best experience: 
- \* **RAM:** 8 GB minimum (16 GB recommended). 
- \* **Screen:** A second monitor is highly recommended (one screen for this book, one screen for Power BI).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Data Used in This Book

All practical exercises use a **synthetic, patient-level integrated
health dataset** created specifically for learning.

The dataset represents routine service delivery across: 

- Antenatal Care (ANC) 
- HIV and ART 
- Malaria 
- Tuberculosis (TB) 
- Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs)

**Privacy Note:** *No real patient data is used. All names and IDs are randomly generated.*

The dataset is intentionally **not clean**. It includes missing values,
inconsistent formats, and common data quality issues that reflect real
health information systems. You will clean, model, and analyze this data
step by step in later chapters.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Files You Will Work With

You should have access to the project folder containing the following
CSV files:

-   `fact_patient_visits.csv` (The transactional line list)
-   `dim_patient.csv` (Demographics)
-   `dim_facility.csv` (Locations and ownership)
-   `dim_date.csv` (Reporting periods)

These files form a simple star-schema structure that will be used
throughout the book.

> **Important:** Do not edit these files manually in Excel. All cleaning
> and transformation will be done inside Power BI.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Knowledge Assumptions

This book assumes: 
- Basic familiarity with tables (rows and columns). 
- Comfort opening files and using software menus. 
- **No** prior Power BI experience. 
- **No** prior DAX experience. 
- **No** database background.

If you have used Excel for reporting (even just for simple sums and filters), you are more than prepared.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How This Book Is Organized

Each chapter builds on the previous one.

1.  **Concept & Structure:** Understanding the "Why" and the ecosystem.
2.  **Preparation (ETL):** Getting messy data ready for analysis.
3.  **Modeling:** Building the relationships (Star Schema).
4.  **Analytics:** Using DAX for indicators.
5.  **Storytelling:** Visualizing data for decision support.

Practical exercises are included in most chapters. You are encouraged to
follow along in Power BI rather than reading passively.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Before You Continue

Before moving to the next chapter, confirm that:

  - Power BI Desktop opens successfully without errors.
  - You can locate the sample CSV files on your computer.   
  - You have created a folder (e.g., `My Power BI Project`) to save your work.

Once these are in place, you are ready to begin.

**The next chapter explains why Power BI matters for Monitoring and Evaluation, and how it fits into real program workflows.**
