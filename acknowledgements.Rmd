# Acknowledgements {-}

This book was shaped by years of working with real-world public health data.

I am grateful to the many colleagues, analysts, program staff, and public health practitioners who, through everyday collaboration and shared problem-solving, have influenced how I think about data use, structure, and accountability. While they are not named here, their questions, constraints, and insights are reflected throughout this work.

The views and any errors in this book are the author’s alone.
